### **🕴🏻 About Me**
I am a student of Delhi Public School Bangalore South Kanakapura road. I am in the 8th Standard. I have always found interest in computers and coding as it gives me a feeling of accomplishment when I am able to teach everyday activities to computers. Now, enough about me, time to learn about my Computer Vision Project!

### **✨ My Bootcamp Ideation - Computer Vision Project!**
My project is basically a set of code which allows  Artificial Intelligence to ./?

### **😕 Problem Statement**
There is too much pollution in the oceans and we cannot manually pick up all the garbage. This can be solved using robots to clean the oceans. But the problem is, how will the robot know what to collect and what-not?

### **💡 Problem Solution**
We can use CV AI to help the robot identify garbage in the oceans so that the life under water stays safe. In short, I am aiming to create a CV Project to help the robot identify trash and other garbages to help clean the oceans!

### **🌏 17 SDGs**
I plan on implementing the "Life Below Water" SDG (Sustainable Development Goal) which is the 14th of the 17 total. This means that I aim to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development.

> NOTE - I will be working with TensorFlow throughout this project as OpenCV and OpenVINO were being stubborn 😊 and it seems to be an effective alternative!
